{Senior Data Engineer}
{Feb '23 -- Present}
{\bodytext{Recently I was promoted to Senior Data Engineer to reflect the ownership and autonomy I have over my projects. My project portfolio includes the same work I was doing as a Data Engineer. To give an example of a recent project, here is something I'm actively working on: a new python ETL pipeline from our data lake / data warehouse to dataset schema registry / data catalog.

\begin{itemize}  
    \item{The ETL pipeline will query AWS S3 for the input and output datasets for our data lake. The data lake is structured as a CDC so the most recent folders are checked for updates.}
    \item{The ETL runs as a cron job alongside other schema registry ingestion pipelines. The cron job is managed by kubernetes and our internal CICD.}
    \item{The dataset schema metadata is loaded into a third party database, who manage the database and UI of our data catalog. The app is used for dataset discoverability and to assist with data governance.}
\end{itemize}
